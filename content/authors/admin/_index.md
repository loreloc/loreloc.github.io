Hi! I am a PhD Student at the [Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/anc) in Edinburgh, supervised by [Dr. Antonio Vergari](http://nolovedeeplearning.com).
My interests include Deep Probabilistic Learning, Tractable Probabilistic Models, Neurosymbolic AI, and anything that can be found at their intersection.
