DeeProb-kit is a unified library written in Python consisting of a collection of deep probabilistic models (DPMs) that are tractable representations for the modelled probability distributions.
The availability of a representative selection of DPMs in a single library makes it possible to combine them in a straightforward manner, a common practice in deep learning research nowadays.
In addition, it includes efficiently implemented learning techniques, inference routines, statistical algorithms, and provides high-quality fully-documented APIs.
The development of DeeProb-kit will help the community to accelerate research on DPMs as well as to standardise their evaluation and better understand how they are related based on their expressivity.
